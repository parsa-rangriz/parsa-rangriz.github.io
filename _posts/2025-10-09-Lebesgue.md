One of the central problems in geometry is to determine the area or volume of a region in the plane or in 3-space. The techniques of integral calculus provide a satisfactory solution to this problem for regions that are bounded by "nice" curves or surfaces but are inadequate to handle more complicated sets, even in dimension one. 

Ideally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we would like to have a function $\mu$ that assigns to each $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a number $\mu(E) \in [0, \infty]$, the $n$-dimensional measure of $E$, such that $\mu(E)$ is given by the usual integral formulas when the latter apply. Such a function $\mu$ should surely possess the following properties:

1. If $E_1, E_2, \dots$ is a finite or infinite sequence of disjoint sets, then
   $$\mu(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup \cdots ) = \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2) + \cdots $$
2. If $E$ is congruent to $F$ (i.e., if $E$ can be transformed into $F$ by translation, rotation, and reflections), then $\mu(E) = \mu(F)$.
3. $\mu(Q) = 1$, where $Q$ is the unite cube,
   $$Q = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon x_j < 1 \text{ for } j = 1, \dots, n\}$$
