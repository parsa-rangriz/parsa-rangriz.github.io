Quick intro for those who might not know: **Rostam** is one of the greatest heroes in Persian mythology—kind of like a mix between Hercules and Achilles. He’s the central figure in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, which is basically Iran’s national epic.

Here’s something cool: both Caesarean births and Rostam-style (Rostamineh) births refer to unnatural deliveries. In the stories, neither Julius Caesar nor Rostam was born the usual way. They were both too large to be delivered naturally, so their mothers’ wombs were cut open—hence, what we now call a C-section.

What’s really fascinating is how these kinds of parallels pop up across cultures. With stuff like this, you start to notice echoes between Homer and Ferdowsi, or similarities across Roman, Arabic, Persian, and Greek mythology. It’s like these stories traveled, morphed, and got retold in different languages and lands. Pretty wild, right?
