For a family of probability densities $f_\mu (x)$, the _loglikelihood function_ is
$$l_x(\mu) = \log(f_\mu(x)),$$
the notation $l_x(\mu)$ emphasizing that the parameter vector $\mu$ is varying while the observed data vector $x$ is Ô¨Åxed. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the value of $\mu$ in the parameter space $\Omega$ that maximizes $l_x(\mu)$,
$$\hat\mu = \arg \max_{\mu \in \Omega}(l_x(\mu)).$$
For simplicity, we assume that $\hat\mu$ exists uniquely.
