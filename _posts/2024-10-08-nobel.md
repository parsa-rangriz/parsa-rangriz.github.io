I’m beyond excited about how much attention spin glass theory has been getting lately. It feels like a golden era for this field!

Here’s the crazy lineup from the past few years:

In 2021, [Giorgio Parisi won the Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/parisi/facts/) for his groundbreaking work on disordered systems, especially spin glasses, and for introducing something called replica symmetry breaking, which totally changed how we think about complex systems with randomness.

Then, [Michel Talagrand was awarded the Abel Prize](https://abelprize.no/article/2024/michel-talagrand-awarded-2024-abel-prize). He took all that messy, beautiful physics from spin glass theory and built rigorous mathematical tools around it using probability theory. The guy literally proved the Parisi formula, which was once just a physicist’s dream.

And just this year, 2024, [John Hopfield received the Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/summary/)! He’s the one who introduced the Hopfield network, an idea inspired by spin glasses, that ended up laying foundational ideas for neural networks. The model uses concepts from statistical physics like energy landscapes and mean-field theory.

And here’s the personal part:

Back in the summer of 2022, I was interning at EPFL in Switzerland—and guess what I was working on? The Hopfield model! I was trying to use it to study a high-dimensional combinatorics problem (specifically graph cuts). In simple terms, I was using tools from physics to try to understand a math problem about slicing big, messy graphs. That same summer, Parisi had just won the Nobel, and it was such a hopeful moment—it made me feel like I was in the right place at the right time.

It’s kind of surreal now, looking back. I got into this area out of pure curiosity, and now the names and models I was reading about in papers are all over the news with Nobel and Abel Prizes. The crossover between physics, math, and even machine learning is becoming more vibrant than ever, and it's a good time to be part of it.
