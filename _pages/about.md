Hi! My name is Parsa Rangriz. I am a prospective Ph.D. student with a B.Sc. at Sharif University of Technology majoring in Physics and minoring in Mathematics. 

Research Interests:
* High Dimensional Statistics
* Statistical Physics
* Random Graphs and Matrices
* Spin Glass Theory
* Combinatorial Optimization

I am primarily interested in the rigorous random graphs problems with different graphical models and spin glasses. I am curious about the behavior of such models in optimizing the mean-field free energies and bounding the combinatorial properties. 


Check out my [CV](/cv) for more information.
