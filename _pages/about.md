I am a Master of Mathematics student in Statistics at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. Aukosh Jagannath](https://aukosh.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned my B.Sc. in Physics with a Minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology in 2023. Also, I completed a summer research internship at EPFL under the supervison of [Prof. Lenka Zdeborová](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en) in 2022.  

My research interests lie in high-dimensional probability, stochastic calculus, random matrices, and statistical physics.
