My name is _Parsa Rangriz_. I am a senior undergraduate student at the Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology (SUT) in Tehran, Iran. Besides, I study mathematics as minor program at the Department of Mathematical Sciences. I inted to apply for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2022.

Research interests: 
- disordered systems, spin glasses, combinatorial optimization, networks, ...
- open quantum systems, thermodynamics of quantum information, notion of entropy, LDPC codes, ...

From July 2022, I will join the Statistical Physics of Computation laboratory at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland as a summer intern under the supervision of Prof. Lenka Zdeborova. More information will be shared.

Also, I am an undergraduate research assistant of Prof. Amir Daneshgar at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, SUT. We work on the implication of covering graph (lift) of random regular graphs based on the replica symmetric solutions and related algorithms (cavity method) in the context of spin glass theory and statistical physics.

Moreover, I did a project under the supervision of Dr. Ahsan Nazir at the University of Manchester in Manchester, UK. I and Adam, a postdoc student, worked together to study the thermodynamic laws of non-conjugate subsystems using a coarse-grained entropy, called observational entropy.

You can find my CV, here.
