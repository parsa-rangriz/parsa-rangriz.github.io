Hi! My name is Parsa Rangriz. With a B.Sc. in physics and minor in mathematics (2018-2023) at Sharif University of Technology in Iran, my research interests center around probability theory, statistical physics, spin glasses, random graphs, and combinatorial optimization problems that combine these areas. Check out my [resume](/files/vitae.pdf) for more information.
