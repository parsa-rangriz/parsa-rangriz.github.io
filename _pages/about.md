Hi! My name is Parsa Rangriz. I am a senior undergraduate student in physics and mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in Iran. My research interests center around probability theory, statistical physics, spin glasses, random graphs, and combinatorial optimization problems that combine these areas. Check out my [resume](/files/vitae.pdf) for more information.
