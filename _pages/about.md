I am an incoming PhD student in Mathematics at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), beginning in Fall 2025. I completed my Master of Mathematics (MMath) in Statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Aukosh Jagannath](https://aukosh.github.io/), and earned my BSc in Physics from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/). Also, I was a research intern at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working under [Prof. Lenka Zdeborov√°](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **probability theory**, **high-dimensional statistics**, **stochastic analysis**, and **random matrix theory**, with a focus on understanding inference and learning problems through the lens of statistical physics.
