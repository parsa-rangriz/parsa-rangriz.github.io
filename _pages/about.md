I'm an MMath Student in Statistics at the University of Waterloo, advised by Prof. Aukosh Jagannath. My current research interests lie in probability theory, high-dimensional statistics, and mathematical physics. 

I received my BSc in physics with a minor in mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in 2023. During my undergrad, I interned at Summer@EPFL 2022. Also, I did some research varying from quantum information and statistical physics to combinatorial optimization and variational algorithms.

My CV can be found [here](/cv).
