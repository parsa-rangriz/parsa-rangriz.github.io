I am an incoming PhD Mathematics student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), starting in Fall 2025. I recieved my MMath Statistics from [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Aukosh Jagannath](https://aukosh.github.io/) in 2025. Prior to this, I earned my BSc Physics from [Sharif](https://en.sharif.ir/) in 2023. Also, I completed a summer research internship at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervison of [Prof. Lenka Zdeborová](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en) in 2022.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of probability theory, high-dimensional statistics, stochastic analysis, and random matrix theory, with a focus on understanding statistical physics through mathematical frameworks.
