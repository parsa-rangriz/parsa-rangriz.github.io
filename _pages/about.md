Hi! This is Parsa Rangriz. I'm an MMath student in statistics at the University of Waterloo, supervised by [Aukosh Jagannath](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). My current research interests lie in probability theory, random matrices, and statistical physics of spin glasses. My CV (as of Oct 2023) can be found [here](/cv).
