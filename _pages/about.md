<!-- 
My name is _Parsa Rangriz_. I am a 5th-year undergraduate student in physics and mathematics at the [Sharif University of Technology (SUT)](https://en.sharif.edu/) in Tehran, Iran. I intend to apply for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2022.

Research interests: 
- Disordered systems, spin glasses, networks, combinatorial optimization, ...
- (Quantum) information theory, quantum thermodynamics, the notion of entropy, ...

I am a part of the [Statistical Physics of Computation](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/spoc/) laboratory at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Lausanne, Switzerland as a summer intern under the supervision of [Prof. Lenka Zdeborova](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en). I am working on the assortative partitions of fully connected graphs based on the replica theory to study the single-spin-ï¬‚ip-stable states in spin glasses.

Also, I am an undergraduate research assistant of [Prof. Amir Daneshgar](http://mathsci.sharif.ir/faculties/daneshgar/) at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, SUT. We work on the implication of covering (lift) graphs of random regular graphs based on the context of spin glass theory and statistical physics.

Moreover, I did a project under the supervision of [Dr. Ahsan Nazir](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/ahsan.nazir.html) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) in Manchester, UK. I and Adam Stokes, a postdoc student, worked together to study the thermodynamic laws of non-conjugate subsystems using a coarse-grained entropy, called observational entropy.
