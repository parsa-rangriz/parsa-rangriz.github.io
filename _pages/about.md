## About me
Hi! I am Parsa Rangriz. A prospective PhD student in Mathematics with a B.Sc. in Physics and a minor in Mathematics at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu) in Iran. My research interests ceneter around probability, statistical physics, spin glasses, random graphs, and combinatorial optimization problems that combine these areas.

Besides my academic career, I do enjoy studying history, especially around ancient dynasties (Greece, Persia, Egypt, Rome), Islamic civilization, and Medieval ages. Moreover, I am interested in historical linguistics. My linguistic knowledge of Persian, Turkic (Turkish and Azerbaijani), and English helped me dig into the deep connections among the languages, their changes, and their origins. I enjoy Persian literature and poetry as well.
