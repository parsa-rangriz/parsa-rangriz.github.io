I am a Master of Mathematics student in Statistics at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. Aukosh Jagannath](https://aukosh.github.io/). Previously, I completed my BSc in Physics and a Minor in Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in 2023 working with [Prof. Amir Daneshgar](http://math.sharif.ir/faculties/daneshgar). Also, I have done an internship at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne under the supervison of [Prof. Lenka Zdeborová](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en) in 2022.  

With a background in probability theory, my research interests revolve around stochastic analysis, random matrices, high-dimensional probability, and statistical physics. My CV (as of Dec 2024) can be found [here](/files/CV.pdf).
