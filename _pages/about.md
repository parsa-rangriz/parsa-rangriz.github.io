I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at UC San Diego. Before that, I received my Master of Mathematics in Statistics from the University of Waterloo in 2025, advised by [Aukosh Jagannath](https://aukosh.github.io/). Before that, I did my B.Sc. in Physics and a minor in Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in 2023. Also, in 2022, I was a research intern at EPFL, supervised by [Lenka Zdeborová](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of probability theory and high-dimensional statistics, with a focus on stochastic analysis, random matrices, and their applications in machine learning and statistical physics. Broadly, I am interested in understanding high-dimensional inference problems, combinatorial optimization, and spin glasses.

My CV is available [here](/files/CV.pdf) (Updated: Dec 2025).
