I'm a MMath student in statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by [Prof. Aukosh Jagannath](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). My current research interests lie in probability theory, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical physics.

My CV (as of July 2023) can be found [here](/cv).
