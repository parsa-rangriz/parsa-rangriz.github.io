My name is _Parsa Rangriz_. I am a senior undergraduate student at the (Department of Physics)[http://physics.sharif.ir/~web/], (Sharif University of Technology (SUT))[https://en.sharif.edu/] in Tehran, Iran. Besides, I study mathematics as minor program at the (Department of Mathematical Sciences)[http://math.sharif.ir/]. I intend to apply for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2022.

Research interests: 
- disordered systems, spin glasses, combinatorial optimization, networks, LDPC codes, ...
- open quantum systems, thermodynamics of quantum information, notion of entropy, ...

From July 2022, I will join the (Statistical Physics of Computation laboratory)[https://www.epfl.ch/labs/spoc/] at (EPFL)[https://www.epfl.ch/en/] in Lausanne, Switzerland as a summer intern under the supervision of (Prof. Lenka Zdeborova)[https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en]. More information will be shared.

Also, I am an undergraduate research assistant of (Prof. Amir Daneshgar)[http://mathsci.sharif.ir/faculties/daneshgar/] at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, SUT. We work on the implication of covering graph (lift) of random regular graphs based on the replica symmetric solutions and related algorithms (cavity method) in the context of spin glass theory and statistical physics.

Moreover, I did a project under the supervision of (Dr. Ahsan Nazir)[https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/ahsan.nazir.html] at the (University of Manchester)[https://www.manchester.ac.uk/] in Manchester, UK. I and Adam Stokes, a postdoc student, worked together to study the thermodynamic laws of non-conjugate subsystems using a coarse-grained entropy, called observational entropy.

You can find my CV, here.
