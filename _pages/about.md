I'm an MMath student in Statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by [Prof. Aukosh Jagannath](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). My current research interests lie in probability theory, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical physics.

I received my BSc in physics with a minor in mathematics at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) in 2023. During my undergrad, I interned at [Summer@EPFL 2022](https://summer.epfl.ch/), supervised by [Prof. Lenka Zdeborov√°](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en). Also, I did some research varying from quantum information and statistical physics to combinatorial optimization and variational algorithms.

My CV (as of July 2023) can be found [here](/cv).
