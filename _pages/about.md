I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Before that, I received my M.Sc. in Statistics from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in 2025, where I was advised by [Aukosh Jagannath](https://aukosh.github.io/). Before that, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics with a minor in Mathematics at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/) in 2023. Also, in 2022, I was a research intern at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), supervised by [Lenka Zdeborov√°](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova/?lang=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of probability theory and high-dimensional statistics, with a focus on stochastic analysis, random matrices, and their applications in machine learning and statistical physics. Broadly, I am interested in understanding high-dimensional inference problems, combinatorial optimization, and spin glasses.
