Welcome to 4Sharif's! This page is all about helping out our friends at Sharif University of Technology, especially those studying physics. I've gathered some resources that could be of great use to you, and the best part is that they're available for free and you don't need to ask for permission to use them. Enjoy!

## Administrative Processes and Educational Services
Here I try to explain the administrative processes and educational services, which are sometimes very complicated and unusual, in a simple language through the experiences that have existed before. If there have been any changes in any of the described processes and the working method has changed, you can inform me through the email below.

## Laboratory Reports
Note: Using someone else's lab reports as your own is considered academic misconduct and can result in serious consequences. It is recommended to always complete your own work and properly cite any sources used.

## Exams
Note: Using previous exams as a study resource is generally acceptable, but it is important to follow your instructor's guidelines. Additionally, relying solely on previous exams can limit your understanding of the material and may not accurately reflect the current course content. It is recommended to use past exams as a supplement to your own learning and preparation.

## Statistical Mechanics III
During the spring semester of 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for [Prof. Ali Rezakhani](http://sharif.edu/~rezakhani/Home.html)'s graduate course in statistical mechanics. I am excited to share the problem sets that I published during that time. They may be useful as a study resource for students interested in the subject. Please keep in mind that the course content and material may have been updated since then.

| -----------   | -------   | ----------   |  
| Set 1   | [PDF](/files/SM3-1.pdf)   | Classical Thermodynamics: Entropy of Mixing, Photon Gas Carnot Cycle, Maximum Entropy Principle; Ensemble Theory: Classical Harmonic Oscillator, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, Curie Susceptibility, Equipartition, Helmholtz Extensiveness. |
| Set 2  | [PDF](/files/SM3-2.pdf)   | Density Operator: The Schmidt Decomposition, Thermal Radiation, Equivalence of Entropies, Spin 1/2 Particle |
| Set 3  | [PDF](/files/SM3-3.pdf)   | Stochastic Processes: Rabbit Evolution, Knight’s Tour, Colored Balls, Transition Matrix, Random Walk, Birth and Death Processes, LGKS Equation |
| Set 4  | [PDF](/files/SM3-4.pdf)   | Stochastic Processes: Fokker-Planck Equation, Random Walk and Diffusion Equation, Kramers-Moyal Equation, Backward Kramers-Moyal Equation, Pawula Theorem; Kinetic Theory: One-Dimensional Gas, Evolution of Entropy, Vlasov Equation, Two-Component Plasma |
