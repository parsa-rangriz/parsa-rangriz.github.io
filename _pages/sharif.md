This page is for Sharif University of Technology undergraduates, especially physics students. Here I put some useful notes and remarkable stuff which could be helpful for them. They are open, and you don't need permission to use them.

## Laboratory Reports
These are my reports for the general laboratory courses. Use them at your own risk.
