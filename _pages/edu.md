Welcome to IRAN Education Resources! This page is all about helping out my friends in Iran, especially physics undergrad students.

## Administrative Processes and Educational Services
Here I try to explain the administrative processes and educational services, which are sometimes very complicated and unusual, in a simple language through the experiences that have existed before. If there have been any changes in any of the described processes and the working method has changed, you can inform me.

## Laboratory Reports
Note: Using someone else's lab reports as your own is considered academic misconduct and can result in serious consequences. It is recommended to always complete your own work and properly cite any sources used.

## Statistical Mechanics III
During the spring semester of 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for [Prof. Ali Rezakhani](http://sharif.edu/~rezakhani/Home.html)'s graduate course in statistical mechanics. I am excited to share the problem sets that I published during that time. They may be useful as a study resource for students interested in the subject. Please keep in mind that the course content and material may have been updated since then.

| Problem Set No. |  File |   Topics |
| -----------   | -------   | ----------   |  
| Set 1   | [PDF](/files/SM3-1.pdf)   | Classical Thermodynamics: Entropy of Mixing, Photon Gas Carnot Cycle, Maximum Entropy Principle; Ensemble Theory: Classical Harmonic Oscillator, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, Curie Susceptibility, Equipartition, Helmholtz Extensiveness. |
| Set 2  | [PDF](/files/SM3-2.pdf)   | Density Operator: The Schmidt Decomposition, Thermal Radiation, Equivalence of Entropies, Spin 1/2 Particle |
| Set 3  | [PDF](/files/SM3-3.pdf)   | Stochastic Processes: Rabbit Evolution, Knight’s Tour, Colored Balls, Transition Matrix, Random Walk, Birth and Death Processes, LGKS Equation |
| Set 4  | [PDF](/files/SM3-4.pdf)   | Stochastic Processes: Fokker-Planck Equation, Random Walk and Diffusion Equation, Kramers-Moyal Equation, Backward Kramers-Moyal Equation, Pawula Theorem; Kinetic Theory: One-Dimensional Gas, Evolution of Entropy, Vlasov Equation, Two-Component Plasma |
| Set 5  | [PDF](/files/SM3-5.pdf)   | Stochastic Processes: Generalized Langevin Equation; The Partition Function: Boltzmann Distribution, Ideal Bose Gas, The Lee-Yang Theorem in Electrostatics, Grand Partition Function |
