## 📘 A Review of *A History of Modern Iran* by Ervand Abrahamian

In this powerful [book](https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/058c64b006c901fd93afa68c7ebefe4d.pdf), [Ervand Abrahamian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervand_Abrahamian) traces Iran’s turbulent twentieth century—from the discovery of oil and foreign interventions to the 1979 revolution. He explores class dynamics, the rise of clerical rule, and the emergence of Iran as a regional power, all through the lens of ordinary people’s lives.

### 📄 [Part I: Qajar Persia and the Persian Constitutional Revolution](/files/Modern_History_Iran_1.pdf)
This section challenges the myth of an all-powerful Qajar state. Instead, it shows a fragmented Iran governed by clerics, tribal leaders, and informal power structures. Abrahamian outlines the forces behind the 1906–1911 Constitutional Revolution, including secular intellectuals, Shi’i clerics, and foreign pressures.

## 📕 [A Review of *Iranian Identity* by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)

This book compiles key essays by [Ahmad Ashraf](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81) on the evolution of Iranian identity, from the post-Sasanian era to the rise of the Safavids. Through religion, language, and national myths, Ashraf traces how Iranian identity was redefined in response to conquest, cultural revival, and ideological shifts. It includes the essay [“Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period”](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period) of Encyclopaedia Iranica.
