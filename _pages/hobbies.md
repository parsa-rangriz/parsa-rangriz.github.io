This page contains my own writings, along with reviews and summaries of some other books I have read and found insightful. The paragraphs are selected because they offer something valuable to the reader and encourage them to explore the entire book. The books span topics such as history, literature, classical poetry, political science, and cultural studies. Although the books are not categorized, a certain order and coherence have been maintained to make them easy to navigate.

* ### [A Review of "Iranian Identity" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
  The book consists of the collected articles by Ahmad Ashraf, a professor at Columbia University, such as "[Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period)". In this book, Ashraf aims to reinterpret Iranian national identity through a historical and literary lens, drawing upon modern perspectives of contemporary orientalists. By referencing the construction of European nationalism, which entered Iranian political discourse during the Persian Constitutional Revolution, Ashraf seeks to present a clear and coherent depiction of the formation of Iranian nationalism, rooted in the countryâ€™s rich cultural and historical heritage.
