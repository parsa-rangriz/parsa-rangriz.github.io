Although the books are not categorized, a certain order and coherence have been maintained to make them easy to navigate.

* ### [A Review of "Iranian Identity" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
  The book consists of the collected articles by Ahmad Ashraf, an Iranian Sociologist, such as "[Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period)". It studies the historical evolution of Iranian national identity from the fall of the Sasanian Empire to the Safavid era. Drawing on Ahmad Ashraf’s framework, it explores how political authority, religion (particularly Shi'ism), language, and myth intertwined to shape enduring conceptions of “Iran” and “Iranianness.” The text highlights how identity was not fixed but continuously redefined in response to conquest, cultural revival, and ideological shifts.
