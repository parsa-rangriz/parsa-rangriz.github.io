<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervand_Abrahamian">Ervand Abrahamian</a> traces Iran’s turbulent twentieth century —

the rise of clerical rule, and the emergence of Iran as a regional power, all through the lens of ordinary people’s lives.

<b>📄 <a href="/files/Modern_History_Iran_1.pdf">Part I: Qajar Persia and Iran's Constitutional Revolution</a></b><br>
This section challenges the myth of an all-powerful Qajar state. Instead, it shows a fragmented Iran governed by clerics, 
tribal leaders, and informal power structures. Abrahamian outlines the forces behind the 1906–1911 Constitutional Revolution, 
including secular intellectuals, Shi’i clerics, and foreign pressures.
