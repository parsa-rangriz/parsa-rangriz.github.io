* ## A Review of "A Modern History of Iran" by Ervand Abrahamian
  * ### [Part I: Qajar Persia and Iran's Constitutional Revolution](/files/Modern_History_Iran_1.pdf)
    This book, written by [Ervand Abrahamian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervand_Abrahamian), an Iranian-American historian and Distinguished Professor of History at Baruch College and the CUNY Graduate Center, reexamines Qajar rule in 19th-century Iran. The first part of the book challenges the common view of the dynasty as all-powerful, showing instead a fragmented system reliant on tribal leaders, clerics, and local elites. With limited finances, no standing army, and weak institutions, the Qajars ruled through informal networks while drawing legitimacy from Shi'i Islam and Iran’s ancient past. Abrahamian also explores the rise of a secular middle class, increasing British and Russian influence, and the conditions that led to the Constitutional Revolution (1906–1911)—a turning point that introduced modern ideas of law, representation, and nationhood.

* ## [A Review of "Iranian Identity" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
  This book brings together key articles by [Ahmad Ashraf](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81), a prominent Iranian sociologist, including [Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period). It examines the historical evolution of Iranian national identity from the fall of the Sasanian Empire to the rise of the Safavids. Using Ashraf’s analytical framework, the book explores how political power, Shi’i Islam, language, and myth combined to shape changing ideas of “Iran” and “Iranianness.” It argues that identity was never static, but constantly reshaped by conquest, cultural revival, and shifting ideologies.
