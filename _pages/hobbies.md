* ## A Review of "A History of Modern Iran" by Ervand Abrahamian
  In this powerful [book](https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/058c64b006c901fd93afa68c7ebefe4d.pdf) of modern Iranian history, [Ervand Abrahamian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervand_Abrahamian), an Iranian-American historian and Distinguished Professor of History at Baruch College and the CUNY Graduate Center, traces the country’s turbulent path through the twentieth century—from the discovery of oil and foreign interventions to the Pahlavi monarchy and the 1979 revolution. He explores Iran’s transformation through war, clerical rule, and shifting class dynamics, highlighting the tensions between the old elites, the intelligentsia, and a growing middle class. With clarity and empathy, Abrahamian centers the lived experiences of ordinary Iranians, portraying a resilient society that has endured upheaval and emerged as a major power in the Middle East.

  * ### [Part I: Qajar Persia and Iran's Constitutional Revolution](/files/Modern_History_Iran_1.pdf)
    The first part of the book challenges the common view of the dynasty as all-powerful, showing instead a fragmented system reliant on tribal leaders, clerics, and local elites. With limited finances, no standing army, and weak institutions, the Qajars ruled through informal networks while drawing legitimacy from Shi'i Islam and Iran’s ancient past. Abrahamian also explores the rise of a secular middle class, increasing British and Russian influence, and the conditions that led to the Constitutional Revolution (1906–1911)—a turning point that introduced modern ideas of law, representation, and nationhood.

* ## [A Review of "Iranian Identity" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
  This book brings together key articles by [Ahmad Ashraf](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81), a prominent Iranian sociologist, including [Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period). It examines the historical evolution of Iranian national identity from the fall of the Sasanian Empire to the rise of the Safavids. Using Ashraf’s analytical framework, the book explores how political power, Shi’i Islam, language, and myth combined to shape changing ideas of “Iran” and “Iranianness.” It argues that identity was never static, but constantly reshaped by conquest, cultural revival, and shifting ideologies.
