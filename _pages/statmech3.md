During the spring semester of 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for [Prof. Ali Rezakhani](http://sharif.edu/~rezakhani/Home.html)'s graduate course in statistical mechanics. I am excited to share the problem sets that I published during that time. They may be useful as a study resource for students interested in the subject. Please keep in mind that the course content and material may have been updated since then.

| Problem Set No. |  File |   Topics |
| -----------   | -------   | ----------   |  
| Set 1   | [PDF](/files/SM3-1.pdf)   | Classical Thermodynamics: Entropy of Mixing, Photon Gas Carnot Cycle, Maximum Entropy Principle; Ensemble Theory: Classical Harmonic Oscillator, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, Curie Susceptibility, Equipartition, Helmholtz Extensiveness. |
| Set 2  | [PDF](/files/SM3-2.pdf)   | Density Operator: The Schmidt Decomposition, Thermal Radiation, Equivalence of Entropies, Spin 1/2 Particle |
| Set 3  | [PDF](/files/SM3-3.pdf)   | Stochastic Processes: Rabbit Evolution, Knightâ€™s Tour, Colored Balls, Transition Matrix, Random Walk, Birth and Death Processes, LGKS Equation |
