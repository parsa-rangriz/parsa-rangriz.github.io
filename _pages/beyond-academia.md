* ### [A Review of "Iranian Identity: The Medieval Islamic Period" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
  The book consists of the collected articles by Ahmad Ashraf, a professor at Columbia University, such as "[Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period)", translated in Persian by Hamid Ahmadi, a professor at the University of Tehran. In this book, Ashraf aims to reinterpret Iranian national identity through a historical and literary lens, drawing upon modern perspectives of contemporary orientalists. By referencing the construction of European nationalism, which entered Iranian political discourse during the Persian Constitutional Revolution, Ashraf seeks to present a clear and coherent depiction of the formation of Iranian nationalism, rooted in the country’s rich cultural and historical heritage.
