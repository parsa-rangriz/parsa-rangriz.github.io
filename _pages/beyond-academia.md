* ### [A Review of "Iranian Identity: Perspectives and the Medieval Islamic Period" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
  The book consists of three articles by Ahmad Ashraf, a professor at Columbia University, titled "[Iranian Identity: Perspectives](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-i-perspectives)", "[Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period)", and "[Iranian Identity: The 19th and 20th Centuries](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iv-19th-20th-centuries)", translated in Persian by Hamid Ahmadi, a professor at the University of Tehran. In these essays, Ashraf aims to reinterpret Iranian national identity through a historical and literary lens, drawing upon modern perspectives of contemporary orientalists. By referencing the construction of European nationalism, which entered Iranian political discourse during the Persian Constitutional Revolution, Ashraf seeks to present a clear and coherent depiction of the formation of Iranian nationalism, rooted in the country’s rich cultural and historical heritage.
* ### An Excerpt from the Gulistan by Saadi
  Gulistan (The Rose Garden), written in 1258 by Saadi Shirazi, is a classic work of Persian literature combining stories and poetry to share lessons about morality, justice, love, and life. Using simple anecdotes and reflections, Saadi offers practical wisdom drawn from his experiences. While rooted in the culture of medieval Persia, the Gulistan continues to be relevant as a guide to ethical living.
