* [A Review on "Iranian Identity: Perspectives and Medieval Islamic Period" by Ahmad Ashraf](/files/Iranian_Identity.pdf)
          <details>
          The book consists of three articles by Ahmad Ashraf, a professor at Columbia University, titled "[Iranian Identity: Perspectives](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-i-perspectives)", "[Iranian Identity: Medieval Islamic Period](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iii-medieval-islamic-period)", and "[Iranian Identity: The 19th and 20th Centuries](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iv-19th-20th-centuries)", translated in Persian by Hamid Ahmadi, a professor at the University of Tehran. In these essays, Ashraf aims to reinterpret Iranian national identity through a historical and literary lens, drawing upon modern perspectives of contemporary orientalists. By referencing the construction of European nationalism, which entered Iranian political discourse during the Persian Constitutional Revolution, Ashraf seeks to present a clear and coherent depiction of the formation of Iranian nationalism, rooted in the countryâ€™s rich cultural and historical heritage.
